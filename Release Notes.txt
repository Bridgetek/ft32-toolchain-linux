Toolchain Readme
----------------
Version: 2.7.6

Restrictions:
- Note that from v2.2.1 onwards, the Application Binary Interface (ABI) has changed compared to v2.1.0. So any libraries compiled with toolchain v2.1.0 or below versions must be recompiled/rebuilt to be used in projects compiled for v2.2.1 or later.
- The RTCs in FT90x Rev B and FT90x Rev C are different. So the software that was written for FT90x Rev B cannot run on FT90x Rev C. i.e. it is not forward compatible. However, from toolchain v2.5.0 onwards, the RTC API for FT90x Rev C is made backward compatible to RTC of FT90x Rev B, i.e. all three modules (MM900EVxA, MM900EVxB, & MM930EVxA) can be supported. 

Known issues:
- The Eclipse IDE distributed with the installer is the 64-bit (x64) version. The Bridgetek plugins are run with a 64-bit version of Eclipse. 
- On Windows the cross-compiler tools are 32-bit executables. There are no issues running 32-bit tools from the 64-bit Eclipse application. Utilities included such as FT9xxProg and FT9xxProgGUI are 64-bit tools.
- TheFT9xxProg utility may trigger virus scanners since it can be connected to through a network port. If this happens then instruct the virus scanner or firewall to open port 3333 for access by the affected applications.

Improvements:
- A faster versions of the FT9xxProg utility is included in this release. The Windows version FT9xxProgGUI has been updated with new logos and icons.

New Features:
- N/A


Hadrware Library and Examples Readme
------------------------------------
Version: 2.7.6

Latest version of source code can be obtained from GitHub: https://github.com/Bridgetek/ft9xx-sdk/

Restrictions:
- From v2.5.0 onwards, the USBD (USB device) ABI has changed to promote asynchronous operation. 
  This provides many advantages for speed and responsiveness when programming a USB device application. 
  Projects will be backward compatible.

Known issues:
- The ADC rail-rail reference is disabled by default, as a result:
	o Voltages between 0 - 350mV are all read from ADC as zero.
	o Voltages between 3 - 3.3V are all read from ADC as max value (1023). 
- The interrupt library does not work properly when the interrupt priority is changed. 

Fixed issues:
- Issue with USB host transfers recovering from a timeout has been corrected.
- Issue with USB host resetting USB 1.1 full-speed hubs fixed.

New Features:  
- N/A
